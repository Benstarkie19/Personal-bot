## Usage
There are only two steps to use this program: 1) enter information and 2) launch the program.

1. You can now enter information using two ways: via a browser (recommended) or a text editor.
    #### Via Browser
    1. At the root directory, run on the terminal:
        `npm run settings`\
        A browser window should open up. If it doesn't and the console says `Server started!`, go to: `http://localhost:3250/` in your browser.
    2. Enter the links of the items you want to track in the URLs tab.
    3. Go to Settings tab and change to your heart's content.
        - If you want to use Proxies, turn it on and create a file called `proxies.txt` in the root directory and fill it with one proxy per line. See [proxies](#Proxies).
        - If you have Amazon link(s), you will see a options to put delay between Amazon items and pick a region. Select a region if you want to only monitor items sold by Amazon and not third party sellers. If you want to use a particular seller or if your region is not in the list, select `Custom` and provide the merchant ID. See [Feedback and Support](#Feedback-and-Support) if you'd like to request a region.
        - If you have Target link(s), you will see additional options to put zip code and API Key. Only change the key if you get API key errors. Refer to the instructions in the following [section](#Via-Text-Editor).
    4. Configure notification options in Optional tab.
        - If you want notifications sent to [Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks), [IFTTT](https://maker.ifttt.com/), or [Slack](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks), expand WEBHOOKS and enter the webhook URL(s) there.
        - If you want notification sent via SMS/Text, expand SMS and choose a method: Amazon Web Services, Email, or Twilio. See [SMS](#SMS).
        - If you want notifications sent to Email, turn on email and enter your service provider information. Some providers (Yahoo, AOL, AT&T) cause problems. Refer to this [section](#Email).
    5. Once you're happy with the settings, click `Save Settings`.\
    `config.json` and `.env` files should now reflect your settings.\
    You can use `CTRL + C` or `CMD + C` to stop the program.<br><br>
        
2. Execute and continue about your day: 
    `npm start` OR `node --experimental-modules main.js`\
    You can use `CTRL + C` or `CMD + C` to stop the program.


### Email
Supported email providers:
```
    Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, Hotmail, Outlook365, QQ, 126, 163, 1und1, AOL, DebugMail, DynectEmail, 
    FastMail, GandiMail, Godaddy, GodaddyAsia, GodaddyEurope, hot.ee, mail.ee, Mail.ru, Maildev, Mailgun, Mailjet,

```

**NOTE:**  If you receive the error: `535 5.7.0 (#AUTH005) Too many bad auth attempts`, most likely you are using Yahoo for the email server or an email server managed by Yahoo, such as AOL or AT&T. Yahoo has implemented an option that by default, does not let 3rd party products access the email servers. To resolve, go to https://login.yahoo.com/account/security and then enable the option to allow apps that use less secure sign in. Use the password generated by "Generate app password". If you are using AOL, do the same thing, from https://login.aol.com/account/security.
